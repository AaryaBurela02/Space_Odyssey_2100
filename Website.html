	</div>
	<p id = "survival2">
		2095: The war starts between humans in need of food, oxygen, place to live using robots.<br>
        2100: Earth loses its shape, not even leaving a single human alive. AI is so developed that it starts ruling the world without humans.<br><br>
        As you can see we have been completely taken by the replicants. We have tried many of the warfare methods but they were all useless. At the first we were no able to differentiate between a human and a replicant but in the recent studies scientists came up with a Z.E.U.S virus test, which consists of a 5 multiple choice questions, that determines whether traces of the computer virus are detected in the guardians implanted nano chip, based on the options chosen by them. This is a necessary step to ensure their fidelity to mankind. <br>
        After so much of research we found that a frequency of 50,000 hertz makes the replicant to loose thier consciousness for 5 minutes approximately and that 5 minutes is very crucial for us to dis mantle the replicant, take to our base and manipulate it such that it fights along with us. But the only thing is even humans cannot sustain to that much high frequency, so we planned to divert them to the nearest Ed gordge stadium with only one human operating the speakers. This is the ultimate and final survival mission. <br> You must train yourselves in the Plot B.2.4 bunk to divert the replicants to yourside, take them to the stadium and lock the gates! We know that this is a very critical time for you to get trained, but the whole human race is under risk. This is the time we get united, raise ourselves and get our planet back!
